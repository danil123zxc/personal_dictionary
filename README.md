# Offline AI Language Learning Assistant

An **offline**, **privacy-first** AI-powered language learning tool that helps you **translate**, **define**, and **practice vocabulary** directly from any text — **no internet required**.

Powered by the **Gemma 3n** language model running locally via **Ollama**, this tool provides context-aware translations, definitions, example sentences, and related word suggestions. All results are stored locally in your personal dictionary for review anytime.

## ✨ Features

- **Offline AI Processing** — Works entirely offline for maximum privacy.
- **Context-Aware Translations** — Extracts key content words, lemmatizes them, and translates them into your target language.
- **Smart Definitions** — Generates short, precise definitions based on the word's meaning in your specific context.
- **Example Sentences** — Creates simple, clear example sentences to reinforce learning.
- **Semantic Similar Words** — Finds related vocabulary using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS + MiniLM embeddings.
- **Personal Dictionary** — Saves all words, translations, definitions, and examples to a local JSON file for future review.
- **Multilingual Support** — Works with multiple languages (English, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese).

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input any text** — e.g., a news article, a short story, or a paragraph you want to learn from.
2. **Word extraction & lemmatization** — Only the most important content words are kept, in their base dictionary form.
3. **Translation** — Words are translated into your target language.
4. **Definition generation** — The model generates short, clear definitions that fit the context of your text.
5. **Example creation** — Simple, natural example sentences are generated for each word.
6. **Related words search** — The app finds semantically similar words from your personal dictionary.
7. **Local storage** — Everything is saved offline in `dictionary.json`.
